Welcome Friends And Fellow Developers!

My name is Matthew and am a self-taught software developer. I'm a Canadian that is passionate about technology, problem solving, communcation, and collaboration. It's my pleasure to be part of the Github community to not only learn but also to supports the many great endeavors contained here. A fun fact about me is that I have spent 5 years living in China and my fluent in Chinese.
